# SiteStudio

**SiteStudio** is a visual, object-based website builder inspired by Blender.
Instead of writing HTML/CSS/JS first, users *create objects directly in the browser* (rectangles, text, components), attach behavior, and SiteStudio generates clean, real code in real time.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Early MVP / Learning-in-Public**

This project is being built step by step while learning web fundamentals and system design.
Expect rough edges, experiments, and frequent changes.

---

## 🎯 Core Idea

* Draw real website elements visually (not mockups)
* Each object = real DOM element
* Attach:

  * Styles
  * Events
  * Animations
  * Logic
* Live HTML / CSS / JS output

Think: **Blender-style workflow → Web output**

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack (Initial)

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Vanilla)

Planned later:

* Canvas / SVG
* Component system
* Exportable code

---

## 📅 Development Log

* **Day 1** – Repo setup, basic structure
* **Day 2** – (planned) canvas + object drawing

---

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
# just open index.html in browser
```

---

## 📌 Goals

* Learn by building
* Create a unique portfolio-level project
* Explore visual programming for the web
